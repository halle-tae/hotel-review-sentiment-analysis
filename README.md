# Sentiment Analysis Using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)

This project focuses on applying **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)** to analyze sentiment data, specifically in the context of hotel reviews. The analysis identifies which aspects of hotels are frequently associated with positive or negative sentiments, providing insights into customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use PMI to examine how noun phrases in reviews correlate with positive and negative sentiments. By identifying strong associations, the analysis highlights aspects that are either appreciated or criticized by customers.

### Key Concepts

- **PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information)**: A measure used to identify the strength of association between two terms (e.g., a noun phrase and a sentiment).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies review data into positive and negative sentiments, then applies PMI to identify key aspects related to these sentiments.
- **Textual Data Processing**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract noun phrases and analyze their sentiment associations.

## Skills and Methods Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques such as noun phrase extraction were applied to analyze review texts.
- **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)**: Used to compute the association strength between hotel aspects and sentiments.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies the sentiment of customer reviews into positive or negative categories.
- **Python**: Employed for text data processing, sentiment classification, and PMI calculation.
